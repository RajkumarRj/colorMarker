Colored Markers - HTML & CSS
This project is a simple HTML and CSS demonstration of colored markers.
It creates a visual representation of colored markers with caps and sleeves using CSS styling.

HTML Structure
The index.html file contains the following structure:

An <h1> element with the title "CSS Color Markers."
A container (<div class="container">) that holds three colored markers.
Each colored marker is represented as a <div> with the class "marker." It includes a cap (<div class="cap">) and a sleeve (<div class="sleeve">).


CSS Styles
The styles.css file contains CSS styles for the colored markers.
Each marker has a specific color, and its cap and sleeve are styled accordingly to create a visual representation.
